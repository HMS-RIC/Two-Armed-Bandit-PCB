# Pin assignments for 2-Armed Bandit PCB
(designed to be backward compatible with existing/old setup)

## Left Port
beam = 6
solenoid = 3
LED = 10
Lick = 2

## Center Port
beam = 5
solenoid = 13
LED = 8
Lick = A0 (14)

## Right Post
beam = 7
solenoid = 4
LED = 9
Lick = A1 (15)

## Auxiliary IO pins
Aux 1 (Laser) = 11
Aux 2 (Inscopix) = 12
Aux 3 = A2 (16)
Aux 4 = A3 (17)


## Changelog
v1.1: swapped Aux-1 and Aux-2, so that Aux-1/Laser could have PWM on pin 11
	  this puts Inscopix on pin 12 (make sure to change the Matlab code for both of these)
